# Endpoints

You can connect up to 10 physical hardphones or softphone endpoints to a PJSIP extension at the same time, or you can run your own PBX and set up an IAX2 trunk between yourself and FreeSTAR Everywhere.  Whichever way you wish to do it, we have a number of Configuration Guides to help you.

## Guides

* [Hard Phone](./hardphones/index.md) _- physical phones or ATA devices_
